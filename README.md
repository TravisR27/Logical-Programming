# Logical-Programming

Practical Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called award.py.
● Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a
triathlon will receive.
● Your program should read in the times (in minutes) for all three events of a
triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculate and
display the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
● The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to
complete the triathlon. The qualifying time for awards is 100 minutes.
Display the award that the participant will receive based on the following

criteria:
Qualifying Criteria                                  Time Range                 Award
Within the qualifying time.                         0 - 100 minutes        Provincial Colours
Within 5 minutes of the qualifying time.            101 - 105 minutes      Provincial Half Colours
Within 10 minutes of the qualifying time.           106 - 110 minutes      Provincial Scroll
